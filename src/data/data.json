  "About": {
    "paragraph1": "The YAIS is designed to move beyond the standard discussion of Africa’s challenges and instead focus on creating actionable solutions. The conference emphasizes innovative thinking as an important avenue for change. At the YAIS, young, bright minds and African field experts will convene to deconstruct issues and produce resolutions across various African industries.\n",
    "paragraph2": "The YAIS format centers around seminar workshops, called “Innovation Labs”, on various topic areas including Finance, Technology, Education, Digital Content Creation, and more. Experts will introduce their industries to their respective Labs, explain some of the challenges they face in their profession, and present a case study from their work that they would like to solve with participants. Participants will then work together through the case study to pinpoint the root causes, identify project goals, and draft approach and implementation strategies.",
    "paragraph3": "The end goal is for our experts to take the solutions back to their businesses, organizations, and communities and set them in action. Moreover, we hope that the work in the Labs will provide all participants with the foundation to turn their innovative ideas about African development into realities after the conference."

Looking into political and social activism, she currently takes classes that examines the divergence of blackness, wondering if it transcends an ocean. Traversing Black archives from Africa to the Americas, she takes classes that expose the juxtaposition of white intrusion as a detrimental contender to the political and socio-economic spheres of both countries. Her past year at Yale, she has joined an African Dance Team and Step Dance Team, as well as volunteered with the Yale Undergraduate Prison Program. Currently working on Capitol Hill and with a non-profit organization, her passion for civil rights and collective Black liberation in communities intensifies. In her free time, she is a Co-Founder of a podcast called Beacon of Eachother that focuses on the intersectionality of students as they navigate their POC experience as adults and take up space at a white institution like Yale. As a rising sophomore she intends to take up more space, bringing not just Black and Brown joy onto the campus, but innovative solutions for Black people everywhere—starting with YAIS.
